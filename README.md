This projects goal was to  do more graphical programming, and introduce the simpler concepts from raytracing to explain methods (or one of them) with which we display 3d objects on screen.

We had to parse a config file specifying the positions of our camera, lights and geometrical objects in space, then display them on screen using a simple lib for drawing pixels in a window (which is actually just a front for opengl)

The drawing process required simple geometry, matrix algebra and very little understanding of how light travels.
It made me very interested in more complex raytracing/pathtracing etc algorithms and I think I will make a much more complex version of this later.
